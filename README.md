# Triplanner - Your Travel Pal ✈️
Triplanner is a planning app to assist users in planning for their vacations and staycations. Users can organise their trips, plan out their itinerary, keep track of their budget and ready their packing list! ✨





Made by Yu Youyou, Rochelle Teh, Nicole Tang and Kensley Liong under the <a href="https://swiftinsg.org">2020 Swift Accelerator program</a>, Triplanner aims to help its users efficiently plan for their trips. We felt that this app would aid in making the process of preparing to go for a trip much smoother as with it, users could more easily plan their trip's itinerary, keep track of their spendings and list out their packing lists.
